# design-patterns
This repo will cover some design patterns, separated by some categories(from "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software") to make them easier to classify and use.

They are divided in 3 bigger categories:
Creational: These will be applied when creating new stuff;
Structural: These will be used when there is the necessity to modify and play with object Inheritance and Composition;
Behavioral: These are mostly used to decouple objects, add flexibility and extendability between classes, and step-up their interactions

    Factories;
